In Coyotes, Conover was able to experience first-hand the journey of the immigrants, as well as the struggles they faced in their new lives. This allowed him to gain an understanding of the motivations, beliefs, and values of the people he studied.\n",

For Conover, this required him to spend time and money traveling to the border and living with the immigrants for a considerable period of time. Additionally, since the researcher is embedded in the group, there is a risk that the researcherâ€™s own bias or preconceived ideas will influence their findings. \n",
